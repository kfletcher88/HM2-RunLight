# HaploMerger2

HaploMerger2 (HM2) is an important upgrade over HaploMerger.

HM2 is an easy-to-use automated pipeline for improving geneome assembly in the post-assembly stage. It consists of a set of executables as well as wrappers for several third-part software.

It is designed to untangle allelic relations between haplotype sequences in a highly-polymorphic diploid assembly, and then reconstruct and output two separated haploid sub-assemblies, the reference (the better one) and the alternative.

HM2 also implements sensitive assembly error correction, a reliable gap-closing method and a hierarchical scaffolding procedure on haploid assembly.
